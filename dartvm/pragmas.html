<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>vm:entry-point</code></td>
<td><a href="compiler/aot/entry_point_pragma.html">Defining entry-points into Dart code for an embedder or native methods</a></td>

<tr>
<td><code>vm:notify-debugger-on-exception</code></td>
<td>Marks a function that catches exceptions, making the VM treat any caught exception as if they were uncaught. This can be used to notify an attached debugger during debugging, without pausing the app during regular execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm:external-name</code></td>
<td>Allows to specify an external (native) name for an <code>external</code> function. This name is used to lookup native implementation via native resolver associated with the current library through embedding APIs. This is a replacement for legacy VM specific <code>native "name"</code> syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm:invisible</code></td>
<td>Allows to mark a function as invisible so it will not appear on stack traces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm:always-consider-inlining</code></td>
<td>Marks a function which particularly benefits from inlining and specialization in context of the caller (for example, when concrete types of arguments are known). Inliner will not give up after one failed inlining attempt and will continue trying to inline this function.</td>
</tr>

<h2 id="unsafe-pragmas-for-general-use">Unsafe pragmas for general use</h2>
<p>These pragmas are available for use in third-party code but are potentially
unsafe. The use of these pragmas is discouraged unless the developer fully
understands potential repercussions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Pragma</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>vm:unsafe:no-interrupts</code></td>
<td>Removes all <code>CheckStackOverflow</code> instructions from the optimized version of the marked function, which disables stack overflow checking and interruption within that function. This pragma exists mainly for performance evaluation and should not be used in a general-purpose code, because VM relies on these checks for OOB message delivery and GC scheduling.</td>

<h2 id="pragmas-for-internal-use">Pragmas for internal use</h2>
<p>These pragmas can cause unsound behavior if used incorrectly and therefore are only allowed within the core SDK libraries.</p>

<th>Meaning</th>

<td><code>vm:exact-result-type</code></td>

</tbody>

<h2 id="pragmas-for-internal-testing">Pragmas for internal testing</h2>
<p>These pragmas are used for inspecting or modifying internal VM state and should be used exclusively by SDK tests.
They must be enabled with the <code>--enable-testing-pragmas</code> flag.
The names of these pragmas are prefixed with "testing".
Additionally, they are categorized into "safe" and "unsafe" forms: "safe" pragmas should not affect the behavior of the program and can be safely added anywhere, whereas "unsafe" pragmas may change the code's behavior or may cause the VM to crash if used improperly.</p>

<h2 id="flutter-tostring-transformer-pragmas">Flutter toString transformer pragmas</h2>
<p>These pragmas are useful to exclude certain toString methods from toString transformation,
which is enabled with <code>--delete-tostring-package-uri</code> option in kernel compilers and
used by Flutter to remove certain toString methods in release mode to reduce size.</p>
<table>
